## [About](About.md)

Hi, my name is Natálie Němcová. 
I’m an aspiring illustrator, 3D sculptor, animator and writer with love for dark folktales and storytelling.
I have been fascinated by nature and fantastical creatures all my life and it left a great impact on my work. 
I devoted my life to studying works of art and mostly European mythology. 
I’m still trying to find my own creative voice as an illustrator and amateur writer.

_Will he make it out alive?_

- "The Boots Walk Quietly" is an animated short that was created in the last summer as a school project
- It’s an animated horror with the fairy tale aspects sprinkled in
- To bring the story to life, I used the drawing program Krita, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere 
- The project was left with an open ending but with a lot of illustrations left to be animated
- And for that, I have decided to continue and make this into my Bachelot work
- Watch the whole short here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIBCO0sSIc

_Cat’s together_

- Storyboard and basic story concept
- Made as an excercise in concept and storyboard for my drawing lessons with Mr. Korman 
- The story is about a cat family, living their dream life, until the arrival in form of a small disorderly kitten 
- It’s basically a more serious story about harder subjects disguised as typical "animal’s adventures" popular in the 1980-1990s (live-action or animated)
  
- The main cast consists of:
  1. Blanka - a prideful sphynx cat who needs to learn to be confortable in her own skin
  2. Rupert - little energetic bengal kitten stealing Blanka’s spotlight and is acting like a spoiled brat
  3. Claudius - an old wise male maine coon cat, trying to keep the family together while facing his own mortality

### Director’s statement
_"Following the mysterious disappearance of her dad, 8-year-old Babu is often alone at home with her parrot. When a thief steals it, Babu sets off on a night-time expedition to save her animal friend. During her journey, she finds unexpected allies: an unsuccessful rapper, a night jogger and a homeless man. Together, they must overcome the mad Professor X who is able to transform humans into animals and vice versa. A film-noir detective puppet-animated story takes place in a contemporary night-time city where the inhabitants take on dimensions of fairy-tale characters and all the while don ́t lose touch with everyday social reality."_
