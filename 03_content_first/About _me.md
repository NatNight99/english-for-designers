# About me 

Hi, my name is Natálie Němcová. 
I’m an aspiring illustrator, 3D sculptor, animator, and writer with love for folktales and storytelling. 
I have been fascinated by nature and fantastical creatures as long as I could remember and it left a great impact on my work. 
I devoted my life to studying works of art, animated films and European mythology. 
I’m still finding my creative voice, but I know what I’d like to achieve in life.

## Where I’m curently at?  

I’m currently studying animation and visual effects on Prague school of Creative communication. And even though I’ve felt more like an illustrator for a long time, I got my first important job in a small animation studio. My workplace, named Anima animation studio, is based in Prague and focuses mostly on puppet animation. I have been working there for almost a year now. I have learned a lot about teamwork and reality of working on complex projects. We are currently making their first animated full-lengh animated movie. I try to help as much as I can in the field of computer innovation and 3D print. 

## How I got here? 

As a child I was enchanted by animated movies (mostly 2D one’s from Disney Reinassance) and from that moment I became obsessed with drawing a creating stories. And I have been on my art journey ever since. 

Beside my love for wildlife and cats of all kind, I got really interested in European mythology. All those beautiful wonders of rather brutal mother nature mixed with Greek heroes and monsters made a great impact on me. 

I got accepted into Art high school of graphic design and animation. It was a mixed experience. On one hand, I’ve learned a lot about programs and how to be critiqued by other people. On the other hand, I became a bit burned out. But that did not stopped me from doing more artwork.

Anyway! I mostly focus on digital art and sculpring in 3D programs. But as an art student, I can do a lot of traditionla techniques as well. I especially love colored pencils and markers. And I also have a history of drawing with my ballpoint pen in classes, until my hand goes blue from ink and my middle finger was damaged forever! 

My main point of interest are mostly making character designs, creating fantastical creatures, illustrations or storyboards. 

Writing stories is my passion. I want to get more into making actual storyboard in the near future. 

Now to a few of my latest projects.
