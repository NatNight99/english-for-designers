### Director’s statement
_"Following the mysterious disappearance of her dad, 8-year-old Babu is often alone at home with her parrot. When a thief steals it, Babu sets off on a night-time expedition to save her animal friend. During her journey, she finds unexpected allies: an unsuccessful rapper, a night jogger and a homeless man. Together, they must overcome the mad Professor X who is able to transform humans into animals and vice versa. A film-noir detective puppet-animated story takes place in a contemporary night-time city where the inhabitants take on dimensions of fairy-tale characters and all the while don ́t lose touch with everyday social reality."_

## My work and innovation process at Anima studio

Almost a year ago, I got accepted into Anima studio s.r.o. to work on their first full-lengh film: _Babu in the night city_. I sculpt lip-synk in 3D programs for a lot of characters. I also edit whatever body part they needs to be changed. Then it all gets 3D printed and they can animate with it. 

It was actually a bit of a challenge at first. Lip-synk in Czech puppetery is not something that is usually done and some projects even failed trying to make it possible. But I think we found our own strategy how to make it. I’m most likely the youngest person that works on that project, so I try to bring as much innovation that I can. It is a big honor and responsibility. 

I have worked on more then 10 characters. I probably did close to 60 (maybe more, I’ve stopped counting) expressions. And I can now do it much faster and better then before. 

If things go smoothly the film should come out in 2026. I hope everything goes well. It could be very important thing for me in the future.
