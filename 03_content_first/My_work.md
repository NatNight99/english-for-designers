### Director’s statement
_"Following the mysterious disappearance of her dad, 8-year-old Babu is often alone at home with her parrot. When a thief steals it, Babu sets off on a night-time expedition to save her animal friend. During her journey, she finds unexpected allies: an unsuccessful rapper, a night jogger and a homeless man. Together, they must overcome the mad Professor X who is able to transform humans into animals and vice versa. A film-noir detective puppet-animated story takes place in a contemporary night-time city where the inhabitants take on dimensions of fairy-tale characters and all the while don ́t lose touch with everyday social reality."_

## My work and innovation process at Anima studio

Almost a year ago, I got accepted into Anima studio s.r.o. to work on their first full-lengh film: _Babu in the night city_. 

- My work on the first long lenght film form Anima studio s.r.o., written and directed by Petr Vodička
- I sculpt lip synk and do 3D editing/modeling of the character parts and then it gets 3D printed so they can animate with it.
- I have been working in the team of artists, who specialize in animation and making of puppetry. It is interesting experience. I work independently but also with people and it gets a bit crazy sometimes. But it’s mostly a big responsibility and honor to be a part of this.
- I have been there for a year there. I have worked on more then a 10 puppets and made more then 50 expressions now (probably, maybe more, it’s a lot, stopped counting at this point, some of them got remade multiple times when we still had no idea what we were doing). 
- If things go smoothily the film is expected to come out in 2026, so if the moutgh movement of the puppets will look great, yey! If not...uhhh...you will know whose fault that is XD It’s not usual to do complex lipsynk with puppets in Czech republic.
