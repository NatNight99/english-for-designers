### Director’s statement
_"Following the mysterious disappearance of her dad, 8-year-old Babu is often alone at home with her parrot. When a thief steals it, Babu sets off on a night-time expedition to save her animal friend. During her journey, she finds unexpected allies: an unsuccessful rapper, a night jogger and a homeless man. Together, they must overcome the mad Professor X who is able to transform humans into animals and vice versa. A film-noir detective puppet-animated story takes place in a contemporary night-time city where the inhabitants take on dimensions of fairy-tale characters and all the while don ́t lose touch with everyday social reality."_

### My work at Anima studio

Almost a year ago, I got accepted into Anima studio s.r.o. to work on their first full-lengh film: _Babu in the night city_. I sculpt lip-synk in 3D programs for a lot of characters. I also edit whatever body part they needs to be changed. Then it all gets 3D printed and they can animate with it. 

It was actually a bit of a challenge at first. Lip-synk in Czech puppetery is not something that is usually done and some projects even failed trying to make it possible. But I think we found our own strategy how to make it. I’m most likely the youngest person that works on that project, so I try to bring as much innovation that I can. It is a big honor and responsibility. 

I have worked on more then 10 characters. I probably did close to 60 (maybe more, I’ve stopped counting) expressions. And I can now do it much faster and better then before. 

If things go smoothly the film should come out in 2026. I hope everything goes well. It could be very important thing for me in the future. 

## Cat’s life ("Under the Cat’s Weather")

### Concept art


_Cat’s together_

This was done as a passion project/exersice in story, character design and storyboard. _Under cat’s weather_ (hint to the popular saying "under the dog’s weather), is a little story concept about a family of cats living their usual cat life, until the arrival of one disordely kitten. Such a happy surprise for vile main character’s birthday to get a new little sibling, who is gonna steal her spotligh soon... 

It is a smaller project in the style of "animal going on an adventure", which were popular in the 1980s-1990s in children media, in the life-action form or animated. It tackles the typical life of anthropomorphic cats living their best yet sometimes mischievous lives with loving owner. Until family problems arrise. But it also tacles some more serious problems, that even people can face (like feelings of not being enough or coming to terms with getting older). 
  
The main cast consists of:
  1. Blanka - a prideful sphynx cat who needs to learn to be comfortable in her own skin
  2. Rupert - little energetic bengal kitten who is stealing Blanka’s spotlight and acts like a spoiled brat
  3. Claudius - an old wise male maine coon cat, trying to keep the family together while facing his own mortality

The storyboard is about how Blanka got a brand new younger brother on her birthday. Well...let’s just say it was a surprise to die for...
