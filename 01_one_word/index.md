## First draft
When I think about a word, that triggers a negative response in me, the first thing that comes to mind is the word: INTERESTING. You might be a little confused right now and I fully agree. Let me explain it as an artist. The word “interesting” in the English language may not have the same connotation as in Czech. Here, it’s just a moment from calling something “weird “, it’s just supposed to be more interested and optimistic way of looking at things we don’t fully understand but try to. 

What I mean by that, for example are those awkward social interactions when you perhaps made something that you poured your heart into, and this is the response you got. That bit of silence, then the air thickens, and the other person does not know, what to tell you to your so-called MASTERPIECE. So they just say: “OH, interesting… “ But what most people mean by that (well, not always, but you get the idea) is something more like: "Uh…I do not share your emotional investment in this.“ 

OR "I just don’t understand it at all, and I do not care. I’ll just give you a short answer and keep going.“ 

OR "Well. I do not like this at all, but I want to be polite about it. I don’t want to hurt your feelings.“ 

"That’s interesting.“ They might mumble and change the subject fairy quickly. Does it always mean they are not sincere? No, some people using this word, may be interested in something you made. So they just give you a nod and this short answer to satisfy you. And then go somewhere else. Those are not usually really interested in what you’ve created. 

But if they truly meant it, they would ask you a few questions. Heck, it they are not a fan of your work, they can still try to see your point of view or be supportive of it. Or they can give you some useful criticism. But if they just say “interesting“ and throw it from the window in the speed of lighting, it might really just be a "That’s weird“ dressed in a polite pair of shoes. Or in a nice sweater they got from their good old granny. And you like their grannie’s cookies, don’t you? 
So just shut your month, eat your cookies and let me change the “interesting” subject really quickly.
