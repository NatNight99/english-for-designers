## Edit

When I think of a word, that triggers a negative response in me, it’s got to be: INTERESTING. You might be a little confused right now and I agree. So let me explain this as an artist. The word “interesting” in the English language may not have the same connotation as in Czech. Here, it’s only an inch away from calling something “weird “. "Interesting" may be a useful word when you want to be optimistic about things you don’t understand. Or if you need to sugarcoat something, you don’t like that much. 

Do you remember those awkward situations, when you created something that meant the world to you, and this was someone’s response? That small moment of silence. Then the air thickens. The other person still has no idea, what to tell you about that so-called MASTERPIECE you made. So, they say: “OH, that’s interesting…“ But what some people mean by that feels more like: „Uh…I do not share your emotional investment in this. “ 

OR “I don’t understand this at all, and I don’t care. I’ll give you a short answer and we can keep going.“ 

OR “Well. I do not like this at all, but I want to be polite about it. I don’t want to hurt your feelings.“ 

“That’s interesting. “ They might mumble to satisfy you. Then the person changes the subject in the speed of light. 

Does it always mean that people are not sincere? No, some of them using this word are interested in what you made. But if they give you a short answer and immediately go somewhere else, they are usually not. 

If they meant it, they would probably ask a few questions. Heck, if they are not a fan of your work, they can still try to see your point of view. People can be supportive of something they don’t understand completely. Some are even capable of giving you useful criticism. But if they only say “interesting“ and nothing else, it might be a "That’s weird“ dressed in a nice pair of shoes. Or in a that cozy sweater they got from their good old granny. And you like their grannie’s cookies, don’t you? So shut your month, eat your cookies, and let me change the “interesting” subject really quickly.
