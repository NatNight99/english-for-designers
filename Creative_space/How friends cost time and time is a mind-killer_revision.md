Greetings. 

Today, I’d like to speak about something that was on my mind for a long time. And that is a rather “uplifting” topic which I named: How friends cost time and time is a mind-killer. 

It is not a very easy thing to talk about, but I’ll try to be as objective as possible. 

As I grew older and became an adult, I’ve realized, that making any meaningful connection was getting harder than before. And that partly goes to the nature of time itself.

But first, I’d like to ask you a few questions before we’ll get right into it.

### 1.	Do you have more than 3 close friends at this moment?
### 2.	Are those your childhood friends?
### 3.	Do you see each other on the daily basis?
### 4.	Can you speak to the openly on about your field of work or study? 


Yes, or no? Now that’s up to you to decide. 

These kinds of questions were haunting me for some time now. Maybe ever since I was 13 years old. And I had to know, if I’m alone in this or not.

## Childhood is timeless 

When I was thinking about the time, I was kid, I’ve concluded that making friends might have been less complicated. It was probably easier compared to my present day. Thanks to a few factors. 

1.	Everything seems more black and white when we are young. We still explore the world around us. It must be more simplified for us to develop properly. We are more adventurous. We are willing to take more risks. And most of us can always come back to our parent’s support is something does not work out.
2.	We don’t judge so harshly. We are still a blank piece of paper. We are not ashamed to make a mistake. Just curious. And honest, sometimes brutally so. We are naturally more open-minded to new things. And I’m not saying children are saints, but I don’t think they can fully comprehend their actions yet. But us not judging everyone or ourselves so harshly makes more free to make connections. 
3.	We are more spontaneous. Most of our friendships start as an action and a reaction. The act of starting to like someone can require just to sit beside them at lunch or to play at the playground. Or even better, our parents do that for us and strike the conversation with the other parent. Or maybe they already know each other. And bam! Just like that, friendship is born! 

And you can still develop your interests and taste too. Maybe you and your new friend both like to draw, or you watch the same cartoon shows. 

Childhood is a magical time where we make memories that will build up most of our character for the rest of our lives. We go and discover together, we grow together. And funnily enough, I’ve heard from my own parents that those kinds of friendships tend to last the longest. 

But childhood is not as timeless as we think. And we will lose the “time does not hold that much power over us” attitude soon enough.

## And everyone lived peacefully…until puberty and responsibility have attacked! 

Puberty comes and hits us like a brick in the face. Everything becomes more complex and complicated. Relationships are no exception to the rule. 

We now understand that the world is a potentially dangerous place, and we cannot trust everyone. Our character and priorities are starting to settle in. We become more hormonal and hopeless with our emotions. Our feelings are all time high. 

And then comes the feeling of insecurity and uneasiness. We want to be accepted by society. But it’s just too much for us to handle. So, we start to act a bit idiotic, for some time. 

Our friendships get pretty beat up by this too. The outside and inside pressures can get too much. Some people might get too wrapped in their first love and can become distant to their friend group as well. It’s natural, I get it. I just don’t understand why some use it as a sole excuse for abandoning their friends completely. 

Our desires and taste also become more defined. We have more responsibility. We start to choose what path in life to take. And your friends can either support or limit you in that regard. 

Eventually, you must take the step. You’ll change your school, location, field of study… Everyone goes their separate way. And sometimes it can be hard to manage all long-distance relationships. 

Being in a friend-group from a young age can set your future standards too. It will dictate in what kind of company you spend most of your time, which is more limited than ever. It affects your hobbies. It will most likely dictate what kind of place in a society you’ll have. 

Your inner circle can make those choices for you. It can open many doors yet close many others at the same time. 

You may not realize this, but the people around you build a huge part of what makes you…You. 

And more decisions start to affect those friendships. You must choose all the time. Time is now more precious. 

You need to choose you future. And to take care of your relationships can be difficult. Sometimes it gets hard to take a proper care of yourself. You may even start to lose interest in what made you friends in the first place at this time. 

Sometimes it feels like everything gets a lot more complicated as we age. We get pickier and more scared that someone will judge us for our interests or what kind of people we spend our time with. 

And don’t get me started on how bad people are at communication. And that can damage our relationships too. 

But wait. It gets even better.

## I suck at “adulting”  

Congratulations, you’ve reached adulthood! How are you feeling? Bad? Too much work? School stresses you our all the time? Oh, you still don’t know what to do with your future? Well, you better hurry up then! 

It seems that after each challenge you overcome, there comes another one to deal with. We change schools, locations, habits and priorities. You can try to make everything go as smoothly as possible, but it might still backfire. And that puts a lot of pressures on our relationships. 

Our free time is even more precious now and there’s not much of it left. Sometimes we lose track of what’s important. You’ll eventually break under that stress. It becomes harder to take care of yourself and others. 

You can just hope that you made the right decisions and chose the right people to have at your side. 

You also work at a job now. And that becomes the place where you’re going to spend most of your time at. You cannot choose your colleagues as you choose your friends. But your career is not exactly your social life, right? 

You come home every day. Who will be there to greet you? Your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife? Your children? Or a dog perhaps? Or…maybe no one? At this point, the reality starts to settle in. You are now a responsible adult. Friendships might really be hard to uphold with a whole family and a job to take care of. Your time is now even more compromised. And the truth is, your friends probably feel the same. Heck, you might be lucky enough to have your spouse as your best friend, but that’s not always the case. 

I know that this is the part of growing up, but it still makes me sad. And those once cherished connections can get lost in all of this chaos. 

But I still want to believe that if you truly love someone as a dear friend, you’ll try to stay in contact with them, to find the will and time to do it, before it’s too late. And you never know, when that’s going to be…

## What really matters

In conclusion, what should we take from this? 

What really matters and can we even fight with time itself? 

When I thought about this topic and rewrote it over and over again, I realized a few things. And those stayed with me. 

And I asked myself: What will you remember and regret the most as you get older and weaker? What will matter to you by then? 

Time is going to get to each one of us. And no one knows how much of it we have left. I do believe that what is true will prevail, but friendships are about taking care of the other person from the both sides. Sometimes life gets hard and it’s a big blessing to have someone you can count on at your lowest. But it’s a marathon and only a few will remain in this game. 

And those are the things I’ve had to learn again. And I’ll probably do it over and over again. But hey, that’s life in all its glory, beauty and cruelty. 

I’m still young. Yes, I’m an overthinker and I’m not a relationship expert. There are no clear answers for anything I wrote about here. Sometimes I get my hopes too high. Sometimes I try too hard to please people around me that might not be the best match for me. 

I just hope I’ll get my priorities straight one day. I hope there’s still enough time left. Because time is a mind-killer. And yes, friends do cost you time and parts of your life and soul. They can make it into a wonderful experience, yet it can hurt like hell when they leave. And sometimes you argue, and things get messy. 

But…if it’s true and strong enough, it will hold both of you in the darkest of times.
