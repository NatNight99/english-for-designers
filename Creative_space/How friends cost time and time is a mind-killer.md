# How friends cost time and time is a mind-killer

Greetings, dear readers or anyone who is so kind to listen to what I have to say. 
Now, that the formalities are out of the way, let’s get right into it. 

Today’s topic is: How your friends cost you time and time is a mind-killer. Now, now, don’t be scared or cynical. I’m simply here to finally put my own thoughts into words. And to share with you that special “something” that most of us probably go through in our life’s multiple times. 

I’d like to start in the present. Can I ask all of you a question? And will you answer me honestly? How many close friends do you have in your present time? Who has more than five real friends in their early adulthood? Are those your childhood friends? Your colleagues? Do you still play the game of “Who is my best friend?” anyway? Or does it not matter to you anymore? 

Those are the same questions I’ve been asking myself for a while now. 
I realized that as I grow older, making any kind of meaningful connection has become a lot harder for me. And the funny thing for me is, that it’s not because I cannot socialize. No, I used to be pretty popular with other kids once. Shocking, I know! But I truly believe that it does nothing to do with if you are more introverted or extroverted. Because both can make good connections, just on their own individual accord. 

All this melancholy which became my present and my near future, has made me rethink some things about myself as a person. I had to search. I turned back time and right into my childhood I went! 

## Childhood is timeless 

When I look back into my own childhood a few things regarding my views on “friendship” come to mind. The first is: as a child, you are still finding out about the world. Everything is new. Everything is simplified before you get the bigger grasp on the more complicated reality. And making friends is the same. Your first friendship starts as a simple action and reaction, a play. It is much easier to make a connection while we are still developing. We don’t judge so harshly; we are still open and impressionable to everything. We are on the top of the world, because we think that everything evolves around us. And we still have time! So much time! 

For me, it was easier to make friends back then. And I’m not saying it with pink-tinted glasses. At that age, we could probably just sit beside someone while having lunch or play on the sand. Or even better: our parents strike a conversation between themselves. Or maybe they are already friends too. That sure makes things easier too. Or maybe we collected the same things or watched the same kind of series or movies. And bam! Friendship forever is born! And those kinds of friendships, that go so far to the past, tend to hold on the strongest against time itself. Well, that’s at least what I’ve heard from my parents. You venture with each other into your own fantastical worlds and spend so much time together that it becomes second nature to each other. You are allowed to discover, make memories and grow together! And that is a once in a lifetime experience. 

But all the good things must come to an end. Because time is merciless. And we cannot run from responsibility forever… 

## And everyone lived peacefully, until responsibility and puberty attacked! 

By the time puberty hits us like a brick into the face, things become more complex and complicated. We now understand that the world is a potentially dangerous place, where we cannot trust everyone. At the same time, nothing is so black and white anymore, it has shades of gray. 

We become hormonal and hopeless with our emotions. Our feelings are on all time high. Our desire to be loved can lead to many wrongdoings and betrayal. And some people are willing to sacrifice one kind of relationship to another. That’s why you might lose friends too. While they can be wrapped in their first “serious” relationship, they can sometimes get more distant too. And I know it’s natural, but I find it absurd to make this as a sole excuse for someone to completely stop caring about you. As if you became strangers overnight. 

Our taste and desires also become more specific as we grow older. We must make more choices and start to think about our spare time, as our responsibilities increase. While we study, we have to set our priorities straight. Expectations can fuel or destroy a relationship too. 

Living in a friend group from a young age can also set your future standards. Because it will dictate, in what kind of company you spend most of your time with. It can also affect what kind of hobbies you will have and even what place in society you’ll have. Your social circle can make those choices for you. It can open so many doors yet close some at the same time. But the people who surround you do build a big part of what makes you…You. 

More and more decisions start to pressure your friendships at this age. You must choose what you want to do in your life. You must choose your next field of study. And this can also mean that you will lose more of your friends on the way. Because you might not see each other on daily basis. And life gets in everyone’s way all the time. 

Or maybe you will slowly lose interest in what made your bond special in the first place. And sometimes people argue, and it ends in catastrophe. Because nothing can hurt anyone more than bad communication. Sometimes it really seems like everything is getting worse the older we get… Because we get scared of the feeling inferiority and that someone else will judge us for our actions. That someone important will not take kindly to our character, the hobbies we have or the people we spend our time with. Social pressures can have a big effect on relationships too…But it’s still up to us! Because we chose our masks for every social event willingly, in every situation and place. And sometimes we lose ourselves and what we love the most in the process. And there is nothing worse than to lose your own self trying to please other people. But that’s what sometimes happens in a relationship too. Sometimes they get twisted and uncomfortable. Some of them might have been not worth it from the start… 

## I suck at “adulting” 

It looks like that after each challenge you overcome, you lose more and more people in the meantime. We change schools, locations, habits and priorities. And that can damage our weaker relationships. Our time becomes more precious because there is not much of it left. We might lose track of what should be important when we face our daily challenges. The pressure we feel on the outside and on the inside can get unbearding. When you start to break under stress, it becomes harder to take a proper care of yourself and others. And sometimes, they don’t exactly take a good care of you either. 

So, you are now officially an adult, congratulations! You survived so far, how are we feeling? Bad? Too much work? School sucks? Oh, you don’t know, what to do with yourself in the future? 

As we all know, this can be a big stressor for many people. You must choose carefully now and just hope, you made the right decisions and chose the right people to keep at your side. It’s important to choose where you are going to put your energy and what is worth it or not. And that, unfortunately, applies to other people as well. 

And then you get your first serious job and that becomes the place, where you are going to spend most of your time, no matter if you like it there or not. And you cannot really choose your colleagues. Work relationships can be tricky as well. But you must learn deal with the fact that your job is now the place you are going to spend most of your time. This is the place you are going to build your career. But your career and social life is not exactly the one and the same, right? 

When you come home, who will greet you first? Is it going to be your girlfriend, your wife, kids or perhaps your four-legged friend? Or maybe…maybe it’s just you… And I’m not saying there is anything bad with being alone. Some people might welcome that after a long and frustrating day. What I’m trying to point out is that you may start to feel bit trapped or isolated. And if you don’t really have a work that fulfills you or you don’t exactly feel connected with your colleagues, it can become hard for you to get through your life. 

At this moment, the reality and the weight of time itself starts to settle in. You are now a responsible adult after all. You have a family to take care of a wife or a husband. And if you are lucky enough, they might be like your best friend. It’s a natural part of life, I get it. But you can still wishfully look back at what used to be and get a bit sad. 

Anyone could eventually go through that. Your priorities change all the time, you have new challenges to face. And not that much free time left. Everyone has. Your friends too. And as they chose again and again with your friendship or connection can get lost in the process. Sometimes it’s no one’s fault. It is a natural part of growth after all. Your friends will have their own families and important matters. You cannot turn back time…. 

But I want to believe that if someone is truly important to you, you can try to stay in contact with them. Yes, your priorities might have changed a bit over time but if there is still chemistry and you enjoy each other’s company, that’s all that should matter. 

And the matter of time…? Well, time is always going to have its deathly grasp on you. But the quality of your life is important too. Maybe you don’t see someone every day, but if you try to reach our or to take interest and once in a while you meet in person and you have a good time, that’s all that really matters. 

## What really matters 

I once thought that some friendships would last forever. I was naive… But the thing that keeps me grounded is the feeling that, I’m surely not alone in this. So maybe, just maybe, if we try enough, we can make it work. Because let’s be honest, no one else other than us can make the decision for us to be happy. World will always push you around. There are simply some things that are out of our control. 

Time will get us all of us one day. It’s best to enjoy the ride while we can. And when you are old and tired, tell me, what are you going remember the most? What kind of memories are you going to cherish the most? What will you regret? I think by that point, we might finally realize, what was and is important. Relationships are important, friendships are important. No, just because they are platonic does not meant that they should be less meaningful by default. 

I want to live a fulfilling life…With the people that love and accept me. But I would be a hypocritical of me to say, that I’m an expert on this topic. No, I’m an overthinker and I’ll always try to please those who matter to me until it might even go against my better judgement. 

I just hope it’s not too late. I know I’m still young and I’m lucky to have the life I live. But I still hope that I have enough time to figure this out, before it’s too late… 

Because time is a mind killer…And yes, friends cost you the parts of your life and your time. And sometimes you get mad with the other person but if you care and are respectable to each other, you can overcome most of those challenges. 

Some friendships are not for better or worse. Some do not last a lifetime. But those, which do should forever be cherished. And let me tell you…There is probably nothing more in this world I would want more that to have that kind of connections with someone. 

I just hope that all of us can get that someday.
