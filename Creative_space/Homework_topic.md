# How friends cost time (and time costs "money")

I’ve been thinking about this a few months now. As I grew older, I started to realize that socializing and making meaningful connections became harder than they used to be.
Your time becomes more precious as you venture into adulthood. You can even say: "Time costs money!" Well, more like it costs you the parts of your life, that you can never get back. This is not a game anymore; it has become more serious. You are now responsible for your life. You have something to lose. You cannot run back and cry to your mommy anymore. Oh well, you can, but it would probably be in vain. You simply can’t spend so much time of your life with people that you don’t have that much in common. You must be pickier, right? That does not sound so unreasonable. So, we tend to be more careful and judgmental.
When we are kids, we live in the moment. We are more open to failure, before the outside forces makes us scared of it. Our fears are more abstract. Things used to be simpler. More “black and white”.

Our friendships mostly start as a simple action and reaction, a play. But with time, we lose this ability. Because the world becomes more complex and complicated. We still have enough time; we are on the top of the world. It used to be easier to make a friend back then, wasn’t it? We could just sit beside someone on lunch table or play on the sand or our parents already knew each other. And Bam! Friendship forever is born! Maybe we watch the same cartoons or collect the same things of whatever was popular at the moment.

Adults are shaped by their own experiences. As we grow and our character becomes more defined, we start to make more choices. And one of them is who we want to spend our time with. Because our friend group will most likely define our activities and hobbies for some time. Everyone has priorities and those tend to connect and resonate with people.

Then we hit puberty and things become even more complicated. We became hormonal and hopeless with our emotions. Which means more conflict with the outside world and us. And some of our feelings become even more intense. The desire to be loved also sometimes leads to many wrongdoings and betrayal. Some people are willing to sacrifice one type of relationships for another. That’s why we might lose some of our friends as well. As people start to pair with each other, they may start to lose interest in other things.
In adulthood, the abyss grows stronger. We start to work in the job which most of us will probably not like anyway. Our job becomes the place where we will try to socialize the most. But you don’t really choose your wonderful colleagues, do you? And some of them are going to suck. And your free time is going to get even busier with family life. You know, your other half and the little devils you spawned into this world are going to take some of your attention as well, right?
You might feel a little burned out by the monotone reality by then, right? Your time is now more compromised. After each school you completed, your friend group grew slimmer. Everyone runs in a different direction and chose different paths that may not meet anymore. Some of them even leave to a different city. Some of them grow on different pace or become uninterested in the things that used to connect you. Some don’t want to stay in touch anymore. Or maybe you know...Life circumstances can be friendships killers as well. And so are your values, views or opinions on something like politics.

So, when we take those things into considerations, we find out that our time really starts to be more precious. Every hour can cost us dearly. We don’t feel as comfortable as we did before, we have everything to lose. Our society does not really reward unproductivity. If it does not work, just throw it away and never look back, you must stay on track. And even though we were once really interested in something or someone, it can be hard to fight against all odds.

We don’t know how much time we have in this world. And what really is important sometimes becomes lost in the process of trying to survive your own life and trying to not lose your mind. Friendships need to be nurtured to stay healthy. There is always going to be price to be paid for every decision. The question is, are you ready to gamble? Are you willing to play this game again and more open to outside influences again...?
