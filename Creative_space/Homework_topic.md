## Topic 

# Are people loosing friends as they venture into adulthood?
I’ve been thinking about this a few months ago. As I grew older, I started to realise that socialising and making meaningful connections became harder. 

Your time becomes more precious as you venture into adulthood. You can even same "Time costs money"! Well, more like it costs you the parts of your life, that you can never get back. This is not a game anymore, now it’s became more serious. You are resposible for your life now and you have something to loose. You cannot run back and cry to your mommy, well, you can but if would probably be in vein. You simply can’t spend so much time of your life with people that you don’t really have that much in common, you have to be more picky, right? That would be unresonable. So we tend to be more careful and judgemental.

When we are kids, we live in the moment. We are more open to failure. Our fears are more abstract. Things used to be more simple and black and white.
