# How friends cost time (and time costs "money")
I’ve been thinking about this a few months now. As I grew older, I started to realise that socialising and making meaningful connections became harder than they used to be. 

Your time becomes more precious as you venture into adulthood. You can even say: "Time costs money!" Well, more like it costs you the parts of your life, that you can never get back. This is not a game anymore, it has became more serious. You are now resposible for your life. You have something to loose. You cannot run back and cry to your mommy anymore. Oh well, you can, but it would probably be in vein. You simply can’t spend so much time of your life with people that you don’t have that much in common. You have to be more picky, right? That would be unresonable. So we tend to be more careful and judgemental.

When we are kids, we live in the moment. We are more open to failure, before the outside forces makes us scared of it. Our fears are more abstract. Things used to be more simple and black and white. 

Our friendships mostly start as a simple action and reaction, a play. But with time, we kinda loose this ability. Because the world becomes more complex and complicated. 
We still have enought time, we are on the top of the world. It used to be easier to make a friends back then, wasn’t it? We could just sit beside someone on lunch table or play on the sand or our parents alredy know each other. And Bam! Friendship forever is born! Maybe we watch the same cartoons or collect the same time of whatever is popular at the moment. 

Adults are shaped by their experiences. As we grow and our character becomes more defined, we start to make more choices. And one of them is who we want to spend our time with. Because our friend group will most likely define our activities and hobbies for some time. Everyone has priorities and those tend to connect and resonate with people. 

Then we hit puberty and things become even more complicated. We became more hormonal and hopeless with our emotions. Which means more conflict with the outside world and ourselves. And some of our feelings become even more intense. The desire to be loved also sometimes leads to many wrongdoings and betrayal. Some people are willing to sacrifice one type of relationships for another. That’s why we might loose some of our friends as well. As people start to pair with each other, they may start to loose interest in other things. 

In adulthood, the abyss grows stronger. We start to work in the job which most of us will probably not like anyway and that’s where we will most likely socialise the most. But you don’t really choose your _wonderful_ colligues, do you? And some of them are going to suck. And your free time is gonna get even bussier with family life. You know, your other half and the little devils you spawned into this world are gonna take some of your attencion as well, right? 

You might feel a little burned out by the monotone reality then, right? Your time is now more compromised now. After each school you completed, your friendgroup grew slimmer. Everyone run in a different directions and chose different paths that may not meet anymore. Some of them even leave to a different city. Some of them grow on different pace or become uninterested in the things that used to connect you. Some don’t want to stay in touch anymore. Or maybe you know...Life circumstances can be frienships killers as well. And so are your values, views or opinions on something like politics. 

So when we take those things into considerations, we find our that our time really starts to be more precious. Every hour can cost us dearly. We don’t feel as comfortable as we did before, we have everything to loose. Our society does not really reward unproductivity. If it does not work, just throw it away and never look back, you must stay on track. And even though we were once really interested in something or someone, it can be hard to fight against all odds. 

We don’t know how much time we have in this world. And what really is important sometimes becames lost in the process of trying to survive your own life and trying to not loose your mind. Frienships need to be nurtured to stay healthy. There is always going to be price to be paid for every decision. The question is, are you ready to gamble? Are you willing to play this game again and more open to outside influences again...?
