# Are people loosing friends as they venture into adulthood?
I’ve been thinking about this a few months ago. As I grew older, I started to realise that socialising and making meaningful connections became harder. 

Your time becomes more precious as you venture into adulthood. You can even same "Time costs money"! Well, more like it costs you the parts of your life, that you can never get back. This is not a game anymore, now it’s became more serious. You are resposible for your life now and you have something to loose. You cannot run back and cry to your mommy, well, you can but if would probably be in vein. You simply can’t spend so much time of your life with people that you don’t really have that much in common, you have to be more picky, right? That would be unresonable. So we tend to be more careful and judgemental.

When we are kids, we live in the moment. We are more open to failure, before the outside forces makes us scared of it. Our fears are more abstract. Things used to be more simple and black and white. 

Our friendships mostly start as a simple action and reaction, a play. But with time, we kinda loose this ability. Because the world becomes more complex and complicated. 
We still have enought time, we are on the top of the world. It used to be easier to make a friends back then, wasn’t it? We could just sit beside someone on lunch table or play on the sand or our parents alredy know each other. And Bam! Friendship forever is born! Maybe we watch the same cartoons or collect the same time of whatever is popular at the moment. 

Adults are shaped by their experiences. As we grow and our character becomes more defined, we start to make more choices. And one of them is who we want to spend our time with. Because our friend group will most likely define our activities and hobbies for some time.
