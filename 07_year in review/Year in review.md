# Year in review 

To be honest, my last year has been quite difficult in a lot of way. I had to evaluate a lot of things about myself and where I’m going and I’m still not sure what path to take. 

## Where am I and where to go
Altought I thought I’ve had everything under control and figured out, I was wrong. And I’ve been feeling a bit down and burned out because of it. And that makes me feel weak. My brain and my emotions don’t work well. 

I know I still want to makes something of value. I still want to tell stories, to make art, but sometimes I get too trapped in my own head, unable to fullfill my ambitions. 

School has been been a bit distracting at times. I still want to preform well but I’ve started to realise, that it might not be the best way to go about things. I started to loose myself while wanting to please everyone around me, to be a good student, a good daughter, a good friend. And by doing so, I slowly lost the sight what’s really important for me. I slowly took the pieces that made me whole and gave it away and now there is not much left. 

But now, I’m know I cannot do this forever. I need to find the way out and put my needs and what I really want to the test. Because it’s my life and noone elses. There was too much going on with me the last year and I have to put a stop to it. I owe it to myself and to everyone around me, to the people that care and have no idea how to help me. 

## The realisation 

I realised a few things those last months and that is that I need to rediscover my passions and things that fullfill me. I’ve abandoned them for such a long time and it has cost me dearly. I need to find my inner child again. I need to reinvent myself, to make a future for myself. I know I have a potencial for more than I’m now, I’m not pround of myself for not being able to do something meaningfull with it. 

I need to stop trying to please everyone, I need to stop having too many overwhelming expecations that just distract me and paralise me. I need to start to like doing art and to write stories, not because there is some box I have to fill but just for me and to make myself happy. 

I have been on this path for a long time now. It’s undestandable that it get’s too much sometimes, chasing your dreams has never been easy. I’m willing to work for it, but now I know, I need to take some time for myself and to reavaluate my life. Because so far, not so good. I have everything I need to make it work in theory but emotionally I’m suffering by self-doubhts and existencional loneliness. 

## The way out 

But before I can face the world I need to face myself first. It’s not going to be easy but I have to try. Because noone else can. My own decisions got me into this situation and now I have to face it head on. I have a life to live. I don’t know where it’s goint to lead me. All I understand is that I cannot go on like this and something has to change.
