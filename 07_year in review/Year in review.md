# Year in review 

To be honest, my last year has been quite difficult in a lot of way. I had to evaluate a lot of things about myself and where I’m going and I’m still not sure what path to take. 

## Where am I and where to go
Altought I thought I’ve had everything under control and figured out, it’s not as easy as I thought it would be. I’ve been feeling a bit down and burned out. I know I still want to makes something of value, I still want to tell stories, to make art, but sometimes I get too trapped in my own head, unable to fullfill my ambitions. 

School has been been a bit distracting at times. I still want to get the best grades and performance but I’ve started to realise, that it might not be the best way to go about things. I started to loose myself while wanting to please everyone around me, to be a good student a good friend and everything perfectly. And by doing so, I slowly lost the sight what’s really important for me. I slowly took the pieces that made me whole and now there is not much left.
