# Year in review 

To be honest, my last year has been quite difficult in a lot of way. I had to evaluate a lot of things about myself and where I’m going and I’m still not sure what path to take. 

## What’s been going on? 
- I’ve been working on my thesis "The Beggining of 3D Animation in Czech republic" and although I had a rought start I’ve discovered some really valuable information about Czech film industry as a whole. Some things made me really sad and frustrated because of the state of things but at least I’m informed now. It has been an interesting ride. I’ve met some great authors and people. It was a good experience and I’ve loved meeting those people and finding out more about them. I’m proud myself that I’ve been able to discover something that not a lot of people know about and to shine a bit of light on that.
- My work at animation studio has been a bit inconstistent over the last months but hey, that’s how it works sometimes. The work comes and sometimes there’s a lot of it and sometimes there’s almost nothing to do. But it’s safe to say that I’m still glad I have a place to work. And it’s still a great honor to have my first important work project a whole full-leight puppetry movie. I hope we will succed because so far the art mastery with the puppets and the enviroment with the animation has been looking very beautiful. It’s amazing to see the story to come to life.
- I have also spend a lot of time thinking about my future and where to go from here. I don’t think I’m quite ready to go to work yet but I’m not sure which school I’ll be able to get into, because I’ve been studying art for so long there is not much to choose from. There have been a few tries to get to those prestige art school which I failed to get into years before and they ended up in failure. I know it does not dictate my self-worth but it still cost me a lot of energy and time which I now know should have gone to more important matters. And now I’m studying for another exams and I’m starting to loose it. The presure is too much and I’m afraid I won’t be able to get my bachelor film done on time so I’ll probably stay on VŠKK for another year...It makes me feel a bit like a failure to be honest. But because of my mental health I now know that it may be the best way to go.
- Personal life has been a bit diffucult to be honest. I think I’ve hurt myself again and I need time to revaluate a few things about myself and about my relationships before it get’s totally out of hand. 

## Where am I and where to go
Altought I thought I’ve had everything under control and figured out, I was wrong. And I’ve been feeling a bit down and burned out because of it. And that makes me feel weak. My brain have not been working prophely for a while now. 

I know I still want to makes something of value. I still want to tell stories, to make art, but sometimes I get too trapped in my own head, unable to fullfill my ambitions. 

School has been been a bit distracting at times. I still want to preform well but I’ve started to realise, that it might not be the best way to go about things. I started to loose myself while wanting to please everyone around me, to be a good student, a good daughter, a good friend. And by doing so, I slowly lost the sight what’s really important for me. I slowly took the pieces that made me whole and gave it away and now there is not much left. 

But now, I’m know I cannot do this forever. I need to find the way out and put my needs and what I really want to the test. Because it’s my life and noone elses. There was too much going on with me the last year and I have to put a stop to it. I owe it to myself and to everyone around me, to the people that care and have no idea how to help me. 

## The realisation 

I realised a few things those last months and that is that I need to rediscover my passions and things that fullfill me. I’ve abandoned them for such a long time and it has cost me dearly. I need to find my inner child again. I need to reinvent myself, to make a future for myself. I know I have a potencial for more than I’m now, I’m not pround of myself for not being able to do something meaningfull with it. 

I need to stop trying to please everyone, I need to stop having too many overwhelming expecations that just distract me and paralise me. I need to start to like doing art and to write stories, not because there is some box I have to fill but just for me and to make myself happy. 

I have been on this path for a long time now. It’s undestandable that it get’s too much sometimes, chasing your dreams has never been easy. I’m willing to work for it, but now I know, I need to take some time for myself and to reavaluate my life. Because so far, not so good. I have everything I need to make it work in theory but emotionally I’m suffering by self-doubhts and existencional loneliness. 

## The way out 

But before I can face the world I need to face myself first. It’s not going to be easy but I have to try. Because noone else can. My own decisions got me into this situation and now I have to face it head on. I have a life to live. I don’t know where it’s goint to lead me. All I understand is that I cannot go on like this and something has to change. 

Looks like I’m going to get be my own knight in a shinning armour after all...Fighting against my own windmills called "The human psyche".
