# Year in review 

To be honest, my last year has been quite difficult in a lot of way. I had to evaluate a lot of things about myself and where I’m going and I’m still not sure what path to take. 

## School and my near future
Altought I thought I’ve had everything under control and figured out, it’s not as easy as I thought it would be. I’ve been feeling a bit down and burned out. I know I still want to makes something of value, I still want to tell stories, to make art, but sometimes I get too trapped in my own head, unable to fullfill my ambitions.
