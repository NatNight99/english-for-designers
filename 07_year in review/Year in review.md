# Year in review 

To be honest, my last year has been quite difficult in a lot of ways. I had to evaluate a lot of things about myself and where I’m going. And I’m still not sure what path to take. 

## What’s been going on? 
- I’ve been working on my thesis "The Beginnings of 3D Animation in Czech Republic" and although it had a rough start, I’ve discovered a lot of valuable information about Czech film industry. Some things made me sad and frustrated but at least I feel wiser now. It has been an interesting ride. I’ve met some great authors and people. It was a good experience and I loved meeting those people and finding out more about them. I’m proud of myself because I’ve been able to discover something that not a lot of people know about and to shine a bit of light on it.
  
- My work at animation studio has been a bit inconsistent over the last months but hey, it always has been. My workload comes and goes. Sometimes there’s a lot of it and sometimes there’s almost nothing to do. But it’s safe to say that I’m still glad I have a place there. And it’s still a great honor to have my first important job full-leigh animated puppetry movie. I hope we will succeed because so far, the art mastery with the puppets, the environment and the animation has been looking very beautiful. It’s amazing to see the story to come to life.
  
- I have also spend a lot of time thinking about my future and where to go from here. I don’t think I’m quite ready to go to work yet. But I’m also not sure which school I’ll be able to get into, because I’ve been studying art for so long there is not much to choose from. 

There have been a few tries to get to the prestige art schools which I failed to do years ago, and they ended up in failure. I understand it does not dictate my self-worth, but it still cost me a lot of energy and time which I know should have gone to more important matters. And now I’m studying for other exams and slowly starting to lose it… The pressure is too much and I’m afraid I won’t be able to even get my bachelor film done on time. So, I’ll probably stay on VŠKK for another year...It makes me feel a bit like a failure to be honest. But because of my mental health I now know that it may be my best chance to pull myself together.

- Personal life has been a bit difficult to be honest. I think need time to reevaluate a few things about myself and about my relationships before it gets totally out of hand. 

## Where am I and where to go

Although I thought I’ve had everything under control and figured out, I was wrong. And I’ve been feeling a bit down and burned out because of it. And that makes me feel weak. My brain has not been working properly for a while now. 

I know I still want to make something of value. I still want to tell stories, to make art, but sometimes I get too trapped in my own head, unable to fulfill my ambitions. 

School has been a bit distracting at times. I still want to perform well but I’ve started to realize, that it might not be the best way to go about things. I started to lose myself while wanting to please everyone around me. To be a good student, a good daughter, a good friend. To be perfect. And by doing so, I slowly lost the sight what’s important for me. I slowly took the pieces that made me whole and gave it away and now there is not much left. 

But now I know I cannot do this forever. I need to find the way out and to put my needs and what I really want to the test. Because it’s my life and no one else’s. There was too much going on with me the last year and I must put a stop to it. I owe it to myself and to everyone around me, to the people that care and have no idea how to help me. 

## The realization 

I realized a few things those last months and that is that I need to rediscover my passions and things that fulfill me. I’ve abandoned them for such a long time, and it has cost me dearly. I need to find my inner child again. I need to reinvent myself, to make my future. I know I have a potential for more than I’m now, I’m not proud of myself for not being able to do something meaningful with it. 

I need to stop trying to please everyone. I need to stop having too many overwhelming expectations that just distract me and paralyze me. I need to start to like doing art and to write stories, not because there is some box, I must fill but just for me and to make myself happy. 

I have been on this path for a long time now. It’s understandable that it gets too much sometimes, chasing your dreams has never been easy. I always worked hard for it, but now I know, I need to take some time for myself and to reevaluate my life. Because so far, not so good. I have everything I need to make it work in theory but emotionally I’m suffering by self-doubts and existential loneliness. 

## The way out 

But before I can face the world, I need to face myself first. It’s not going to be easy, but I must try. Because no one else can do that for me. My own decisions got me into this situation and now I must face it head on. I have a life to live. I don’t know where it’s going to lead me. All I understand is that I cannot go on like this and something must change. I must change… 

Looks like I’m going to get be my own knight in a shining armor after all...Fighting against my own windmills called "The human psyche".
