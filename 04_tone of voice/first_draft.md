# Voice, Tone and style
To be honest, I’ve never taken very big interest in brands as a whole. I sure prefer some like Wacom or KOH-I-NOOR HARDTMUTH for art resources. And if I really have to grab something to eat really fast and unhealthy, I would most likely choose McDonalds. But do I really care for how those brands sound like...? Oh well, not really, ’ interested in what they have to offer but I don’t need to see what they preach on Twitter. 

So it was not an easy task for me to choose which I find to be as a good example or which do I really trust. 

## Inspiring brands 

So here are a few which I think are pretty good at what they are trying to sell:

1. Ikea - they are very down to earth, accesible for anyone. Their webpages are really well made, they are practival, friendly and welcoming. 
2. Wacom - is more reserved yet offer a lot of good tips and learning tutorials for creative people. They have well designed web full that goes well with their products and skillset their users might find helpful.
3. Wendy’s and Duolingo - those brands are not very familiar to me but from what I know about them is their up to date and quick witted style of humor from their social media. I kind of like their cheesy and quick style of humor. They are more suited for people that spend their timeo on the internet and they know what’s up. I also like, how they can be daring and playful with their audience. And also Wendy’s have a pretty funny rivalry with other fast food company and I find it pretty hilarious.
